Howdy reader!
My name is Vipul Bansal and I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Electrical & Electronics Engineering.

While in college I study Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, how electric transformers operate, how motors rotate, how electricity is generated and how signals are modulated & demodulated. Back at home I code!
