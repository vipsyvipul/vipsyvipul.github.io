Howdy reader!
My name is Vipul Bansal and I recently graduated.

I enjoy reading books and non-fictions hold me longer than fictions do (Harry Potter series being an exception). When not reading I mostly devote my time writing code, designing websites and watching cute cat videos.

Hey I am free for next few months so you can check out my [work](http://vipsyvipul.github.io/work) and ping me your interest at bansalvipul.111 (at) gmail.com
