So today I (finally) start my journey into this sweet blogging world. I always wanted to write blogs, share my experiences and let the world know what I am upto. 
Thanks to Tom Preston-Werner, Nick Quaranto, and many [awesome contributors](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors)!

I could have started even earlier but lack of time required to manage a blog pressed me to delay it for a bit of time. However, I utilized this time to learn more about internet and blogging and decided to compile all my knowledge in the form of a book. I named it [Blog: From Building to Celebrating](http://www.amazon.com/Blog-Building-Celebrating-Vipul-Bansal-ebook/dp/B00BAT954W)

###What to expect from this blog?
Nothing! Do not expect me to share any earth-shattering, mind-boggling or breathtaking news. I will write on random topics ranging from life philosophy to electrical systems to algorithms.
